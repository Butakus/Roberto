# Roberto
This repository contains all the code developed for Roberto. Roberto is an experimental rover platform to test sensors, robotic parts and other toys.

The robot is currently controlled by a Raspberry Pi as main computer and an Arduino Mega as low-level driver.

## Contents
[arduino](https://github.com/Butakus/Roberto/tree/master/arduino) contains the different libraries (lib) to control the hardware mounted on the robot (sensors and actuators) and the Arduino modules developed for Roberto (src).

[rpi](https://github.com/Butakus/Roberto/tree/master/rpi) contains the code for the Raspberry Pi.


## TODOs
This will never end. What will be next?
* Add install script to copy Arduino libs into sketchbook directory.
* Finish documentation for current software.
* Add a "doc" directory with API information and datasheets.
* Add libraries for different sensors.
* Implement the base station modules for control and visualization.
