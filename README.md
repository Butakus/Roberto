# RobertoDriver
This is a driver to control Roberto's functions. Roberto is a rover I've been developping since a few years ago until forever. It is an experimental platform to test sensors, robotic parts and other toys.

The robot is currently controlled by a RaspberryPi as main computer and an Arduino Mega as low-level driver.
Here you can find the code for the Arduino.

## TODOs
This will never end. What I'm planning to do next?
* Finish documentation for current software.
* Add libraries for different sensors.


## Contents
